For a long time, I've wanted to start a simple blog, a no-frills platform where I could share random thoughts in plain text. Then, I stumbled upon a great tutorial for [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/skills/github-pages). Within minutes, I had this blog up and running.

The next step is to setup up my own domain here. From what I've seen, it should be a relatively [simple process](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site). I'll leave this as a reminder for my future self to figure out.
