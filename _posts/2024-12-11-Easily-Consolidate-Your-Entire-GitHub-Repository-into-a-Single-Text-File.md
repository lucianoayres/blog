Working with large codebases can sometimes feel like juggling a million files. Copying and pasting source code files into Large Language Model (LLM) prompts can quickly become time-consuming and inefficient. But there’s a handy alternative: using the entire source code from a GitHub repository’s tar.gz file. Let’s dive into how this can simplify your workflow.

### The Problem

When you're dealing with extensive projects, managing individual source code files can be a hassle. Constantly moving files back and forth between your development environment and LLM prompts not only eats up time but also disrupts your focus. Merging all source code into a single file is one option, but there’s an even easier way to access the entire repository in one go.

### What is a tar.gz File?

A tar.gz file is essentially a compressed archive that bundles multiple files and directories into a single file. It’s a popular format for distributing source code because it preserves the directory structure and makes downloading large codebases straightforward. While tar.gz files contain specific tar file markers, all the source code text files are listed within, and LLMs can easily infer and process them without any issues.

### Downloading tar.gz Files from GitHub

There are a couple of simple ways to download a tar.gz file from a GitHub repository:

**Through the Web Interface:**

1. Navigate to the repository’s [tags page](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/tags). For example, you can visit [NumPy’s tags](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/tags).
2. Choose the tag or branch you want to download.
3. Click on the **Download** button to get the tar.gz file.

**Direct Download Links:**

You can also download the tar.gz file directly using specific URLs. Here’s how:

- **Branch:**

  ```
  https://github.com/numpy/numpy/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz
  ```

- **Tag:**

  ```
  https://github.com/numpy/numpy/archive/refs/tags/v2.2.0.tar.gz
  ```

Replace `numpy/numpy` with your desired repository and adjust the branch or tag as needed.

### Extracting the Repository Source Code

Once you have the tar.gz file, extracting the entire source code into a single text file is straightforward. Here’s a sample Python code snippet to help you get started:

```python
# Download the tar.gz file
!wget https://github.com/numpy/numpy/archive/refs/tags/v2.2.0.tar.gz

# Decompress the file
!gunzip v2.2.0.tar.gz

# Display the contents of the tar file
!cat v2.2.0.tar
```

This script downloads the tar.gz file, decompresses it, and optionally rebuilds the source code tree for easier navigation. Despite the presence of tar file markers, the actual source code text files are clearly listed and can be effectively processed by LLMs without any issues.

You can try out the sample code using this [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MOdH9DTvM_WCPLBB4Ey6bM5lPiRlFSAv?usp=sharing).

### Limitations

While using tar.gz files is efficient, there are some limitations to be aware of:

- **Binary Files:** Repositories often include images and other binary files. These can add a significant number of characters to your text file, potentially exceeding the token limits of LLM prompts.
  
- **File Filtering:** To avoid this, you might need to use more complex Unix commands to filter out unwanted files. Alternatively, you can use specialized tools to manage which files are included.

### Introducing Taco

To make filtering easier, I developed a tool called [Taco](https://github.com/lucianoayres/taco). Taco allows you to include or exclude files and directories based on name patterns, helping you streamline your codebase for LLM prompts without the hassle of manually sifting through files.

### Wrapping Up

Handling large codebases doesn’t have to be a drag. By leveraging GitHub’s tar.gz files, you can efficiently manage and extract your source code in one go. And with tools like Taco, you can fine-tune which parts of your codebase you want to include, keeping your workflow smooth and productive.

Give it a try and see how it can simplify your development process!
